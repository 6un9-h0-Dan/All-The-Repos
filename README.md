# All-The-Repos
Update All the Repositories!
  
## Reason this was made:  
A simple script to cd into every /opt subfolder repository location and make a pull request to make sure everything is updated.  Git recently made this a bit difficult I noticed so I wanted to make this as easy of a process for myself and others.  
  
## Usage:  
cd /opt/  
sudo git clone https://github.com/blindpentester/All-The-Repos.git  
cd All-The-Repos  
sudo chmod +x alltherepos.sh  
sudo ./alltherepos.sh
