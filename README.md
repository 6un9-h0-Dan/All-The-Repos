# All-The-Repos
Update All the Repositories!
  
## Reason this was made:  
A simple script to cd into every /opt subfolder repository location and make a pull request to make sure everything is updated.  Git recently made this a bit difficult I noticed so I wanted to make this as easy of a process for myself and others.
